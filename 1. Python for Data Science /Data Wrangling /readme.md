# Data Wrangling

This project demonstrates essential Data Science and Machine Learning concepts using a dataset named employee-data.csv. The dataset contains employee details such as name, department, salary, experience, age, job role, and performance indicators. Using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn, this project performs complete data analysis and predictive modeling.

The notebook covers:

🔍 1. Data Loading & Cleaning

Importing CSV data

Handling missing values

Removing duplicates

Converting data types

Outlier detection

📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics

Salary distribution

Department-wise employee counts

Salary vs Experience visualization

Correlation heatmap

🤖 3. Machine Learning Model

Building a Linear Regression model

Predicting employee salary based on experience, age, and role

Splitting dataset into train/test

Evaluating model using:

MAE

MSE

RMSE

R² Score

📈 4. Visualizations

Histograms

Bar graphs

Line charts

Scatter plots
All visualizations are generated using Matplotlib.

🗂️ 5. Practical Learning Output

This project is ideal for:

Students learning Data Science

Beginners practicing EDA + ML

Colab/Notebook practical assignments
