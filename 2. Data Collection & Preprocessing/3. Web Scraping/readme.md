# Web Scraping with Python – Data Collection Practical

## 📌 Project Title
Web Scraping with Python using Requests and BeautifulSoup

---

## 📖 Description
This project demonstrates how to collect real-time product data from a live website using Python.  
The data is extracted using the **Requests** and **BeautifulSoup** libraries, structured using **Pandas**, and stored as a **CSV file in Google Drive** through **Google Colab**.

The project focuses on the **Data Collection** phase of the Data Science lifecycle.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To understand the concept of web scraping  
- To extract real-time product data from a website  
- To parse HTML content using BeautifulSoup  
- To store structured data in CSV format  
- To integrate Google Drive with Google Colab  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Requests** – for sending HTTP requests  
- **BeautifulSoup (bs4)** – for HTML parsing  
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation  
- **Google Colab** – execution environment  
- **Google Drive** – data storage

## 🌐 Target Website
- https://books.toscrape.com  
*(This is a public website created for web scraping practice.)*

---

## 📊 Data Collected
The following product attributes are extracted:
- Book Name  
- Price  
- Rating  
- Availability  

---

## 🧪 Output
- Tabular output displayed in Google Colab
- Sample preview of scraped data
- CSV file stored in Google Drive

**Output File Name:**  
`scraped_products.csv`

**Storage Path:**  
`/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/DSE(extra)/2. Data Collection/`
