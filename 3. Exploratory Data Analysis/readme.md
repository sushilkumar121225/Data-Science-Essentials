# 🚢 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

📌 Project Overview:
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset to understand passenger characteristics and survival patterns.
EDA helps in identifying trends, relationships, and insights using statistical summaries, visualizations, and correlation analysis.

📂 The analysis includes:

✅ Distribution plots
✅ Survival analysis
✅ Correlation heatmap
✅ ASCII-style headings for better console readability

🎯 Objectives:

✅ Load and explore the Titanic dataset from a CSV file
✅ Analyze survival patterns based on gender and passenger class
✅ Visualize distributions of age and fare
✅ Identify relationships among numerical variables using correlation analysis
✅ Present results in both graphical and textual (ASCII) formats

📂 Dataset Information:

✅ Dataset Name: Titanic Dataset
✅ Source: DataScienceDojo (public dataset)
✅ File Used: titanic.csv
✅ Total Records: 891
✅ Total Features: 12

🔑 Important Columns:

Column Name	Description
PassengerId	Unique passenger ID
Survived	Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass	Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
Name	Passenger name
Sex	Gender
Age	Age of passenger
SibSp	Siblings/Spouses aboard
Parch	Parents/Children aboard
Fare	Ticket fare
Embarked	Port of embarkation

🛠️ Technologies Used:

✅ Python 3
✅ Pandas – data manipulation and analysis
✅ NumPy – numerical operations
✅ Matplotlib – data visualization
✅ Seaborn – advanced statistical plots
✅ PyFiglet – ASCII text formatting

⚙️ Installation & Setup
Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-eda.git
cd titanic-eda

Step 2: Install Required Libraries
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn pyfiglet

Step 3: Dataset Placement

Ensure titanic.csv is placed in the same directory as the Python file or Jupyter Notebook.

▶️ How to Run the Project
python titanic_eda.py


OR
Run all cells if using Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis Performed
1️⃣ Data Loading & Inspection

Display first 5 records

Check dataset structure using .info()

Generate statistical summary using .describe()

2️⃣ Survival Analysis

Overall survival count

Survival comparison by:

Gender

Passenger class

3️⃣ Distribution Analysis

Age distribution

Fare distribution

4️⃣ Correlation Analysis

Correlation matrix for numerical features

Heatmap visualization

📈 Visualizations Included

Histogram of Age

Histogram of Fare

Count plot of survival

Survival by gender

Survival by passenger class

Correlation heatmap

All plots are generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

🖥️ ASCII Output (Console Based)

To enhance readability, PyFiglet is used to print:

Section headings

Analysis titles
in large ASCII text format inside the console.

📌 Key Insights

Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males

Passengers in 1st class had higher survival chances

Fare shows a positive correlation with survival

Age has a weak correlation with survival
