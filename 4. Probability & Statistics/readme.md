# Hypothesis Testing in Python 📊

## 📌 Objective
This project demonstrates **Hypothesis Testing techniques** using Python on a real dataset.
The aim is to understand and apply:
- t-test
- Chi-Square test
- ANOVA

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains academic details of students.

| Column Name | Description |
|------------|------------|
| Gender | Male / Female |
| Study_Hours | Hours spent studying |
| Exam_Score | Final exam score |
| Department | CS / IT / ECE |

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
- Google Colab

## 🔬 Hypothesis Tests Performed

### 1️⃣ Independent t-Test
**Purpose:**  
To check whether there is a significant difference in exam scores between male and female students.

**Null Hypothesis (H₀):**  
Mean exam scores of males and females are equal.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):**  
Mean exam scores are different.

---

### 2️⃣ Chi-Square Test of Independence
**Purpose:**  
To determine whether gender and department selection are related.

**Null Hypothesis (H₀):**  
Gender and department are independent.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):**  
They are dependent.

---

### 3️⃣ One-Way ANOVA
**Purpose:**  
To compare exam scores across multiple departments.

**Null Hypothesis (H₀):**  
All department means are equal.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):**  
At least one department mean is different.

---

## 📈 Visualizations
- Histogram for t-test comparison
- Bar chart for Chi-Square analysis
- Box plot for ANOVA comparison

---

## ▶ How to Run
1. Open **Google Colab**
2. Upload `hypothesis_testing_dataset.csv`
3. Paste the Python code
4. Run all cells

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project provides a practical understanding of hypothesis testing and statistical decision-making using Python.
